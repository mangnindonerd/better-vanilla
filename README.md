# vanilla_improvements
Personal project to improve Minecraft through resource- and datapacks while maintaining a vanilla feel.

Datapacks used:
The following datapacks are from https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/ :
- BIGGER PHANTOMS: This datapack increases the size, damage and health of phantoms over time. The longer the player doesn't sleep, the stronger the phantoms get.
  
- MORE MOB HEADS: Every mob in the game has a certain chance to drop it's own head. For the percentages refer to the corresponding documentation.

- PLAYER HEAD DROPS: When a player is killed by another player, they drop their head. 

- UNLOCK ALL RECIPES: All crafting recipes are automatically unlocked when starting the world.

Additonally, some crafting recipes from https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/ and some custom ones are installed. Refer to the corresponding documentation for a full list.

The resourcepack folder contains a pack that was created with https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/. It contains a .txt document with the texture changes listed.
