Additionally I have added some crafting recipes with the help of https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/:
- 3 leather + 2 lead + 2 tripwire hook -> 1 saddle
- 1 iron ingot + 2 iron nuggets -> 3 chain
- Smithing: 1 golden apple + 1 netherite ingot -> 1 enchanted golden apple
- Chainmail armor can now be crafted using chains. With the change in the chain crafting recipe, full chainmail armor can be crafted with 10 iron ingots and 2 iron nuggets remaining. Compared to the 24 iron ingots needed to craft full iron armor, chainmail armor is now a more affordable early game alternative to iron armor.
